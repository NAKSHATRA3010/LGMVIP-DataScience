Repository for maintaining all the Tasks related to the Internship Program I am working on for LetsGrowMore

TASK 1 : Iris flower Classification

Here we are given a dataset of the measurements of petals and sepals of the Iris Flowere Species. The dataset contain intotal 3 species. Using this dataset we have to train the model to predict the Species for the given data. I have used the K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm to train and test the model. By using KNN algorithm I have succesfully predicted the species with an accuracy of 96.66%. 

TASK 4 : Image to Pencil Sketch With Python

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image.
