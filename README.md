Repository for maintaining all the Tasks related to the Internship Program I am working on for LetsGrowMore

**BEGINNER LEVEL TASKS**

TASK 1 : Iris flower Classification

Here we are given a dataset of the measurements of petals and sepals of the Iris Flowere Species. The dataset contain intotal 3 species. Using this dataset we have to train the model to predict the Species for the given data. I have used the K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm to train and test the model. By using KNN algorithm I have succesfully predicted the species with an accuracy of 96.66%. 

TASK 4 : Image to Pencil Sketch With Python

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. 

**INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TASKS**

TASK 1 : Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier()

Here we are given a Iris Flower Classification Dataset with the measurents of petals and sepals of the Species. Using the dataset we had to create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. By using Decission Tree Classifier I have successfully predicted the species using confusion matrix and classification report with an accuracy of 98%

**ADVANCED LEVEL TASKS**

TASK 1 : Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting

In this task we have to build a model that can  read the handwritting using CNN and Tensorflow. MNIST data is used for the predictions, we can load the dataset using keras library.After that we need to process with the data cleaning i.e. reshape the image dimensions and convert the dependent variables from integers to binary class matrix. Design the model using Tensorflow and keras libraries and than compile the model to test the accuracy. To test the model  save an image with a variable name and predict the output using .predict() function. In this project I have successfully trained the model using Tensorflow and CNN and have gained an accuracy of 98.2%.
